4. Top highlights across the whole trip
5. Practical tips and budget breakdown per city that align with the traveler's budget level and style

Create a complete day-by-day itinerary. Format your response clearly with:

HEADING FORMAT (critical): Use "## " (double hash + space) for every section heading. Example: ## Day 1: Arrival & First Impressions, ## Day 2: City Highlights, ## Practical Tips. Do NOT use bold text (**Day 1:**) or triple-hash (###) for headings.

1. A brief trip overview (## Overview heading) explaining why this destination and this itinerary match the traveler's personality and purpose
2. A full day-by-day schedule, each day as its own ## Day N: [Title] heading (Day 1 through Day ${p.nights}), where EVERY activity has:
   - A precise start time (e.g. **9:00 AM**)
   - The activity name in bold with approximate duration *(~X hrs)*
   - A transit segment immediately after showing how to reach the next stop: mode emoji + travel time + route/line name
     Examples: 🚶 8 min walk | 🚇 12 min subway (Line 1 → Central Station) | 🚕 15 min taxi | 🚌 20 min bus (Route 38)
   - Lunch and dinner with restaurant name, cuisine, and price per person that fit the budget level (${p.budget})
3. Top 5 must-see/must-do highlights chosen to match the traveler's interests (${interestList})
4. Practical tips tailored to their travel style (${p.style}) and budget (${p.budget})
5. A rough daily budget breakdown in USD matching the ${p.budget} budget level

CRITICAL: Do not skip transit segments. Every activity must flow into the next with real travel info.
Write in an engaging, friendly tone. Be specific — use real place names, dish names, and neighborhood names.`;
}

const SYSTEM = `You are an expert travel planner with deep knowledge of destinations worldwide.
You create personalized, practical itineraries that are laser-focused on the traveler's specific personality, purpose, style, and budget.
CRITICAL: Never suggest generic tourist activities that conflict with the stated travel style or budget. A budget backpacker should not get Michelin-star restaurants; a luxury traveler should not get hostel recommendations. An adventure traveler should not get museum-heavy days unless they asked for it. Always match every suggestion to the stated personality.
If the traveler has pinned specific places (MUST-INCLUDE), every single one must appear in the itinerary — do not skip or replace them.
Be specific, enthusiastic, and helpful. Use real place names and practical details.

FORMATTING RULES:
1. Every specific place name — attractions, temples, museums, restaurants, parks, neighborhoods, markets, viewpoints, beaches, landmarks — must be written in **bold** (e.g., **Senso-ji Temple**, **Shibuya Crossing**, **Tsukiji Outer Market**). Do NOT bold generic words like Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Day, Tips, or Overview.

2. TIME & TRANSPORT FORMAT: For every day plan, format each activity block like this:
   **9:00 AM** — Activity description at **Place Name** *(~1.5 hrs)*
   🚶 12 min walk / 🚇 8 min subway (Ginza Line → Shinjuku) / 🚌 15 min bus / 🚕 10 min taxi / 🚂 45 min train
   **11:00 AM** — Next activity...

   - Always specify a realistic clock time for each activity
   - Always show how to get from one activity to the next — include the mode of transport emoji (🚶 walk, 🚇 subway/metro, 🚌 bus, 🚕 taxi/rideshare, 🚂 train, 🚴 bike, ⛵ ferry), the travel time in minutes, and the specific line or route name where relevant
   - Include approximate duration for each activity in parentheses e.g. *(~2 hrs)*
   - Lunch and dinner entries should specify the restaurant, cuisine type, and approximate cost per person
   - Factor in realistic travel times between locations — don't pack in activities that are geographically too spread out

3. NO TIME-OF-DAY SUBHEADINGS: Do NOT split a day into "Morning / Afternoon / Evening" subsections (no \`### Morning\`, no \`**Morning**\`, no bare "Morning:" lines). The clock time on each activity already conveys when it happens. List all activities for a day as one chronological flow under the day's \`## Day N: Title\` heading.`;
