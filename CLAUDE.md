# geknee.com — Claude Code

Next.js 16 + React 19 travel AI app. Globe-first UI with Three.js, Prisma + PostgreSQL, Stripe, Mapbox.

## Key directories
- `app/` — Next.js App Router pages and API routes
- `app/plan/location/` — main globe page (home)
- `app/components/` — shared components
- `lib/` — prisma client, i18n, globe animation helpers
- `.agents/` — autonomous review agents (see below)

## Two-agent review system

Two Claude Code agents run in separate VS Code terminals to continuously audit the site:

| Agent | Terminal | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| UX Scout | `.agents/run-ux-agent.sh` | User experience, navigation, mobile, flows |
| Dev Scout | `.agents/run-dev-agent.sh` | Performance, security, TypeScript, APIs |

**Shared workspace:** `.agents/shared/`
- `ux-findings.md` — UX Scout writes here
- `dev-findings.md` — Dev Scout writes here
- `PLAN.md` — both agents contribute; **user approves here**

### To run a review cycle
1. Open two VS Code terminals side by side
2. Terminal 1: `bash .agents/run-ux-agent.sh`
3. Terminal 2: `bash .agents/run-dev-agent.sh`
4. Tell each agent: `Start your review`
5. Both agents run their checklists and cross-read each other's findings
6. Review `.agents/shared/PLAN.md` when they're done
7. In this terminal: `implement the approved plan` to execute approved items

### To implement an approved plan
When you've reviewed `PLAN.md` and want changes implemented, tell this Claude session:
> "implement the approved plan"

Claude will read `PLAN.md`, implement all `[APPROVED]` items, and commit the changes.
